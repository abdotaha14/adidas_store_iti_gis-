# adidas_store (Simple E-commerce website)
 
It is the first website that I developed during ITI GIS Journey study. 
It is a simple store specializing in shoes, enabling the user to add products to the cart and increase the quantity as he wants.

I used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

- I implemented fetching API calls in this app to get products and display them in the application. I used localSorage to store the chosen products in the cart.
